# 11/03/2023 Weekly TA Meeting
Total Meeting Time: 10 minutes

# Discussion Points/Action Items:

Revise communication plan - having a single communication outlet that can be reviewed is best
 - most likely going to use Discord for this

Use case diagrams should not only include specific actions with the application, but a high-level overview
of the functionality as well.

Revise the architecture diagram to include the components we need for our application
 - what kind of API calls will we make
 - what types of files are we utilizing (.ejs .js etc.)

Import wireframes into our 'Lab 10 Outline' document

Add the rest of our file/folder hierarchy to our git repo
