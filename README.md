Buffs ++ Application description: Users can register as either a tutor or a student if they do not have an account. Users can login as either a tutor or a student depending on their account type. Home page will feature different feeds depending on account type - tutors will view students looking for help, students will see tutors offering it. Users can log in and out of the application and the session will be maintained. There will be a database that stores student-tutor pairs, usernames/user emails and passwords and other user identifiers. Users will have a full UI to interact with the application, including a profile page to update different features of their account, and can post on their respective feeds. Might introduce an admin account to manage users.
